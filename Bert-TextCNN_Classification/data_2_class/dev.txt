Further, the water collected within the reservoir may be used at a future time to fill the clothing iron, thus conserving water. If the user wishes to fill the iron with water, the user may use the water already collected within the water reservoir or may, alternatively, fill the reservoir with water from an external source via the port.	1
In embodiments employing the pattern described above with relation to FIGS. 7A-7C, the combination of groove regions 44 on each of the circumferentially spaced head sections 16 may form a generally helical path for cuttings to flow around the outer circumference of the bit body 12 (FIGS. 1 and 6). Such a configuration may direct the cuttings upward (as the bit is positioned during drilling) and out from the bore hole as the earth-boring bit 10 is rotated in the bore hole. The flow of cuttings upward and outward from the bore hole may reduce the thickness of the cuttings bed, or may substantially eliminate such a cuttings bed.	1
This aspect of the machine is particularly important due to the how the tufting head traverses the backing fabric, during the tufting process, in order to tuft yarn row-by-row. To wit, in creating each row of tufts, the needle carriage generally advances in one lateral direction while its individually controlled needles selectively insert their yarns. If the row being created is to contain different yarns (ex: red and blue), occasionally, a trailing needle threaded with one color of yarn will need to remain idle while advancing past a segment of its designated tufting positions while a leading needle carrying a different colored yarn is commanded to insert a continuous span of its yarn along a segment of its designated tufting positions within that row. Then, when the leading needle finishes its segment, the needle carriage will reverse course in order to reposition the trailing needle to initiate tufting along its previously neglected stretch of tufting positions. By minimizing needle gauge, the cumulative distance of reverse travel by the needle carriage is effectively reduced, and the amount of time consumed in tufting a complete multicolored row is reduced accordingly.	1

The present disclosure relates to a method to improve the performance of reservoir simulators, and to widen the range of systems that can efficiently be modeled. The present disclosure relates to determining fluid flow in a subsurface reservoir. One embodiment divides the reservoir into discrete volume elements. Fluid within the volume elements is represented, for example, by it pressure, saturation, and/or composition. For one or more fluid phases comprising the fluid, the potential for each volume element is determined. The volume elements are ordered according to their potentials for each phase comprising the fluid. A local, fully coupled time-step sequence is determined using a local conservation solution based on the potential ordering of and for each fluid phase. The fluid flow is determined using a global conservation solution based on the local, fully coupled time-step sequence.	1

There are a number of advantages with the present invention. B utilizing at least one tube in which a gripping member is slidably arranged, a very fast and accurate gripping of the suture threads is ascertained. Further since the ring are readily available from a storage means on the instrument, it is easy to place the ring in relation to the suture threads for joining them by the ring.	1
It is contemplated that other covers and regulating plates having any combination of apertures and windows may be used with any of the dispensers shown herein.	1
In operation, methodology of the invention utilizes this three position triggering mechanism to expel resin cartridges from the device barrel into a bore hole. The device can be prepared for operation by attaching the air inlet fitting to an air source which can be performed, for example, with the trigger in position one. In this position air flow is prevented from flowing through the air inlet. The trigger can then be placed in a second position such as depicted in FIG. 7. This position allows air to flow through the inlet and also through the outlet creating a venturi effect and drawing the piston back through the barrel toward the triggering mechanism. At least one resin cartridge can then be loaded into the barrel through the first end. Typically, two cartridges will be utilized per operation of the device.	1
The package may form a storage space for a product, which may be, for example, a food product, or a medical device, which may remain inside the package during and after treatment. The package may also contain a working gas fill, which may be air, or a mixture of gases, which may include noble gases. An atmospheric non-equilibrium plasma (ANEP) is produced within the package by a voltage gradient applied from outside the package. By selecting the working gas mixture, the duration of the ANEP creation, and the duration of the treatment, the treated product may have reduced contamination, or be sterilized, depending on the specific application. The working gas mixture, the equipment geometry and the operation voltage are selected so that the electrodes may be situated in the ambient manufacturing environment and produce reactive species within the package, while avoiding or minimizing the production of such species outside of the package.	1
Generally speaking, the present invention is directed to a feminine care absorbent article that contains multiple printed patterns of graphical objects visible from a body facing surface. The layout and design of the patterns are carefully selected in the present invention to achieve a synergistic masking effect that helps visually disguise the presence of bodily fluids or stains around the periphery of the article. Such “passive” stain masking is achieved, in part, through the use of printed patterns that are distributed in an asymmetric manner about both the longitudinal and transverse centerlines of the article. Asymmetry may be provided in a variety of ways, such as through the use of objects of different sizes, colors, shapes, and designs. Among other things, the asymmetrical nature of the patterns allows the color of the bodily fluid to better blend with the visual nature of the patterns, and also draws the user's focus away from the areas in which any stains are located. In addition to such asymmetric distribution, the printed patterns are also strategically positioned within the article to produce the desired optical impact. Namely, the patterns are located at or near the periphery of the article and at least partially extend into portions of the body facing surface that overlie the absorbent core. Once again, this partial overlap into the absorbent core region helps further improve the capacity of the article to “passively” mask stains.	1
A further object of the present invention is to provide a positioning apparatus for steelmaking lances of an electric arc furnace arranged with respect to the EAF to which they are applied in such a way as to be tiltable therewith.	1

The blocking condition can also thereby be met, when the set point pressure has already been raised at least once within the present operating cycle. In so doing, the total number of cases, in which the set point pressure can be raised, is reduced. This once again reduces the stress on the fuel system and thus lengthens its service life.	1
According to a yet further aspect of the invention, the bone plate implant is formed monolithically from one piece of for example implant grade stainless steel. This way, the bone plate implant can be manufactured comparatively inexpensively and the material interconnection can be formed easily without encountering any jointing problems.	1
Embodiments of the present invention are based, at least in part, on the discovery of a pressure-sensitive adhesive composition containing expandable graphite. In one or more embodiments, the expandable graphite is dispersed within the constituents of the pressure-sensitive adhesive; in other words, the pressure-sensitive adhesive forms a matrix in which the expandable graphite is dispersed. In other embodiments, the expandable graphite is located within a region or layer within the pressure-sensitive adhesive where the expandable graphite is concentrated. In yet other embodiments, the expandable graphite is both dispersed within the pressure-sensitive adhesive and located within a concentrate layer or region. In particular embodiments, the pressure-sensitive adhesive composition is mated to a building material to provide a building material with increased and flame and/or fire resistance while providing the building material with a mechanism for attachment. In one or more embodiments, the building material is advantageously a roofing membrane, and the composition of the present invention can be used to form a fully-adhered roofing system having improved flame-spread and/or fire resistance. In other embodiments, the building material is underlayment. In yet other embodiments, the building material is a moisture, vapor or air barrier.	1
Another very important advantage of the product of the present invention is that said ETP monoethanolamine salt Form D is stable, under ICH guidelines accelerated stability conditions, as better described later and in the experimental part. This better stability is important in the pharmaceutical composition, since it guarantees efficacy and safety of the pharmaceutical product.	1
This invention is directed to representational selection of nucleic acids from a complex mixture. The nucleic acids include DNA, such as genomic DNA (gDNA) or cDNA, or RNA, such as messenger RNA (mRNA). Representational selection can be used to obtain a sample having complexity substantially equivalent to the nucleic mixture or to obtain a subsample having desired lower level of complexity. Selection of subsamples allows for the separation of informative sequences from the less informative sequences that contribute to distortion and/or bias in subsequent analysis. The subsample can be any desired representation of sequences within a complex mixture. One particularly useful subsample consists of an accurate representation of unique sequences within a genome or within a portion of a genome. Such a sample represents a genomic blueprint of the sequence composition devoid of distortions or variance due to sequence copy number. Such a single copy genomic blueprint is particularly useful in diagnostic and other medical applications because it reduces the required sequence coverage necessary for subsequent analysis by eliminating sequence redundancy.	1
The device may further be configured to detect cycling cadence and cycling posture (e.g., sitting or standing). Conventionally, cycling cadence is detected using a device that directly counts wheel rotation. The present device may calculate cycling cadence using rider torso movements. Since cycling may involve a variety of body movements, the device is able to discriminate between events seemingly related to cadence and actual cadence events to more accurately determine cadence. Because the device also includes heart rate measurements and possibly other measurements, and storage, a user is able to obtain and/or record cycling related activity metrics without separate and distinct bike mounted equipment. Such a function is particularly useful for indoor cycling (IC) (sometimes referenced as “spin”) classes where the user is riding an IC bike in a club but does not have their personal cycling computers mounted to the bike and is nonetheless able to record detailed metrics of a ride. The device also, in some implementations, identifies user position, such as standing or seated, on a bike by identifying accelerometer signal characteristics and removing false events.	1
The synchronously saccharified fermentation of Radix Puerariae to produce fuel ethanol is a process in which the structure of Radix Puerariae fibers is damaged, Radix Puerariae starch is released and the fuel ethanol is made from Radix Puerariae starch. If Radix Puerariae flavonoids are not extracted from the residues when the synchronously saccharified fermentating Radix Puerariae is used to produce the fuel ethanol, it not only causes resource waste, but also gives rise to environment issues. If Radix Puerariae flavones are extracted from the fermentation residues, Radix Puerariae will be utilized comprehensively, which boosts the economic effects and benefits the industrial production of Radix Puerariae.	1
According to the present invention, for instance when drilling a large diameter hole to a depth of 10 m, since a pilot hole of small diameter is first drilled to a predetermined depth, for example around 0.5 m, then the hole is enlarged for the predetermined depth, and these processes are repeated multiple times (for example, 20 times) to drill a deep hole of large diameter, there can be provided an effect of precisely maintaining the verticality of a large diameter hole. In addition, since it is possible to reduce the time to assemble and disassemble multi-stage rods required for inserting a hammer drill along a deep hole, the time for drilling operation reduces and the drilling operation can be simplified, thereby reducing the total cost for the drilling operation.	1
Accordingly, in comparison with a situation in which a cover member is attached with respect to the guide block by bolts or the like, the cover member can be simplified in structure, together with being more easily assembled through use of the retainer.	1
Specifically, the transducer of the present invention includes a pneumatically responsive, lightweight "shutter" or light controlling member which is movable by virtue of the vacuum force below the tape loop, and which, when so moved, modifies a light source/photocell couple. The shutter is loosely positioned in a light impervious housing. This housing is connected to a wall of the vacuum column by a short conduit or length of tubing. The movable member is moved from a stable position to an unstable position by virtue of vacuum force at this portion of the vacuum column wall. With such a construction, the movable member responds quickly to a change in pressure at the column wall, and a relatively high signal output occurs at the photocell.	1
Beyond prevention, in the event that initial cranial molding or skin breakdown is observed, preferred methods of the invention prompt caregivers to interventionally secure the force-distributing cranial support in a corresponding position on the subject's head, both to help in treatment of the deformation or skin breakdown, as well as to prevent further harm. The treatment aspects are enabled by the ability of the force-distributing cranial support to distribute external cranial forces and to distribute and reduce skin interface pressures on the areas of the subject's head where compressive forces are otherwise concentrated and, hence, tend to cause partial or complete capillary collapse. By distributing and reducing as much, the force-distributing cranial support thereby helps treat and allow natural healing of tissue that has already partially deteriorated due to pressure points.	1
The locking mechanism and the internal housing may be located at a first end of the male block while the worm screw may be axially positioned through a second end of the male block such that the worm screw remains disposed exterior of the male block while the internal housing remains disposed interior of the male block. The male block may further include a first cavity and a second cavity in fluid communication with each other such that the internal housing may be rotatably seated inside the first cavity and prohibited from being axially displaced out from the first cavity. Such an arrangement provides the unexpected and unpredictable advantage of interfitting the male and female blocks together into a compact and rigid assembly thereby greatly reducing the risk of exposing a weak part of the apparatus that may be accessed and broken by an intruder.	1
The spine roll has the ability to provide dynamic and static stability during a stretch or strengthening exercise. It is able to help relax the spinal muscles, stretch and strengthen the surrounding musculature during core stabilization or dynamic exercises through its ability to align parallel with the spine and roll perpendicular to the spine. The neutral spine roll helps emphasize the natural shape/alignment which is easier to sustain during and after exercise.	1
The intumescent layer can be formed from a plurality of expandable, intumescent particles suspended in a thermoplastic material. The intumescent particles can be formed from any suitable intumescent material, including known materials that are only expandable in a single direction, such as expandable graphite. Orienting the individual particles of intumescent material in different orientations within the thermoplastic material enables the layer to be expandable in at least the primary and secondary directions, even if each intumescent particle is only expandable in a single direction. Encapsulating relatively small intumescent particles within a thermoplastic matrix can insulate the intumescent particles from the surrounding atmosphere, which may inhibit degradation of the intumescent material. The thermoplastic can be selected to exhibit relatively little creep at room temperature (when compared to Palusol™), which can provide an intumescent layer that is generally resistant to creep at room temperature, even if the intumescent material used to form the particles has a high creep susceptibility. The thermoplastic material is selected to have a melting temperature that is lower than an activation temperature of the intumescent particles, so the plastic can be melted without activating the expansion of the intumescent particles. This enables the mixture of intumescent particles and thermoplastic material to be extruded, and may allow the thermoplastic material to melt and flow around portions of the fire door prior to, and during the activation of the intumescent particles.	1
The pocket-hole drilling implement in exemplary embodiments according to the present invention provides: efficiency, ease of use, quickness in application by introduction of a workpiece sensor/initiation switch when a workpiece is placed, which replaces a foot or a hand operated switch; capability to handle different thickness of a workpiece by a movable stop fence that adjusts the drilling depth; safety to prevent human finger injury by a short stroke clamping actuator; the assurance of not drilling pocket-holes on the sidewall of a workpiece by a W-shaped plunger 57 that is disposed inside of a fence 50 and an initiation switch 52 mounted therein; a clamp pad sized to the width of pocket-holes or the diameter of a step-drill to prevent drilling pocket-hole on the sidewall of a workpiece; a blower or an ejector pump to remove wood chips; the ability to drill two pocket-holes into a workpiece where a user can adjust the pocket-hole spacing in-between; the ability to drill multiple pocket-holes into a wide workpiece in one setup by detachably mounted drilling/guide modules on a rail that is at a right angle with respect to the drilling direction; the ability to drill at least two dowel-holes on the edge of a board that is to be joined to a side panel in addition to multiple pocket-hole drilling; extended usage/life of a step-drill by having a clearance in a drill guide bore for the cutting edges of a major diameter of the step-drill; and a lever or a secondary electric motor that eliminates the use of shop air to operate the machine.	1
Conventional process control environments may include one or more control system(s) in communication with multiple valve controllers independently controlling corresponding ones of multiple valves. For example, an isolation valve (e.g., an on/off valve, a shut-off valve, etc.) may be operatively positioned in series with a control valve. The isolation valve may be independently controlled by a first valve controller in communication with a control system, and the control valve may be independently controlled by a second valve controller in communication with the control system. Placement of the isolation valve in series with the control valve may advantageously prolong the life of the control valve. For example, although control valves are suitable for controlling the flow rate of a process fluid, control valves are typically not intended to provide tight shutoff of the flow of the process fluid. When a control valve is implemented to shut off the flow of the process fluid, excessive wear on the valve trim and seat may occur, and the control valve may begin to leak the process fluid even when the control valve is in the fully-closed position. By implementing the isolation valve to shut off the flow of the process fluid that would otherwise require shutoff via the control valve, the valve trim and seat of the control valve are protected from excessive wear.	1
According to embodiments, a fireproof door including a water passage defined by partitions from the lower part to the upper part of the fireproof door is provided to allow water to flow from the lower part to the upper part of the fireproof door upon occurrence of fire. Thus, flames and heat can be effectively blocked.	1
Since the first and second rotors 21 , 23 are located on the same shaft, the velocity, or revolutions per minute (RPM) of the rotors 21 , 23 are the same. However, due to the rollers 24 of the second rotor 23 being located at an angle relative to the rollers 22 of the first rotor 21 , there is a delay between when the first rotor 21 starts to push a pocket of fluid through the first tube 30 and when the second rotor 23 starts to push a pocket of fluid through the second tube 40 . Additionally, as mentioned above, the second tube 40 has a smaller diameter than the first tube 30 and thus is capable of pushing smaller fluid pockets than the first tube 30 . Consequently, the fluid flow rate of the first and second tubes 30 , 40 are different with the fluid flow rate of the first tube 30 having periods of high and low flow that are opposite the periods of high and low flow of the second tube 40 , i.e. when the first tube 30 has a period of high flow, the second tube 40 will have a period of low flow and vice-versa. Therefore, it is believed that a flow and pressure output will result that has smaller fluctuations in pressure and flow as compared to rotor assemblies having one rotor delivering the fluid, via a tube, to a surgical site.	1
It is another object of the invention to provide a process for preparing vinyl chloride, selectively and in good yield by the reaction of ethylene with cupric chlo-ride under carefully controlled conditons of temperature and contact times.	1

These methods provide effective ways for removing guanidinium catalysts such as hexaethyl guanidinium (HEG) and catalyst byproducts such as pentaethyl guanidinine (PEG) from mixtures formed during the process in the substantial absence of water, thereby avoiding the formation of an emulsion.	1
A femto base station of this embodiment obtains, from a wireless terminal connected to the femto base station, information regarding a reception state of a signal supplied to the wireless terminal from another base station installed near the femto base station so as to determine whether the femto base station is displaced.	1
There is a problem that the Radix Puerariae solid state fermentation ethanol technique can not be carried out continuously. As such, the invention provides a method for performing the Radix Puerariae solid state fermentation ethanol using a continuous solid state fermentation device. A study of ethanol fermentation was carried out using the continuous solid state fermentation device shown in FIG. 2. Fermentation and separation were coupled in such a device, and CO 2 was used as a circulating carrier gas to separate the ethanol obtained by fermentation from the fermented materials. In this way, the effect of the heat generated during fermentation on the fermentation may be reduced on the one hand, and the inhibition of ethanol may be decreased on the other hand.	1
Thus, some of the advantages of this preferred embodiment of the invention include: 1. A non-round, e.g. square, cross section of the actual UV radiation chamber for an optimal radiator configuration; chamber with a thin-walled housing. 2. Prevention of dead spaces in the inflow region. 3. An outstanding swirling of the medium after the entrance into the UV radiation chamber which is entrained by the main flow.	1
It has now been discovered that continuous multiple filament fiber bundles can be uniformly spread at lower tensions thereby increasing permeability to resins, decreasing gaps from roping, and decreasing fuzz due to damage thereby providing a superior prepreg product and ultimately a superior article of manufacture made therefrom. Such improvements are achieved by strategic use of tension control throughout the spreading apparatus. This advance drives the tension of the fiber bundles very high and then drops it down low such that by using moderate tensions throughout the entire apparatus the fiber spread is increased without the use of extremely high tensions that were otherwise thought necessary to achieve such objectives. Additionally, use of higher differential speeds between the driven roller bars and the running fiber bundle has also been shown to improve fiber spreading mechanics.	1
According to another aspect of the invention, the extending portions may be provided at positions that are symmetrical in the longitudinal direction with respect to a center of the battery cell. For this reason, the battery cell can be supported in good balance.	1

The results are summarized in Table 1, which provides the solvents and the weight % of additives used. The column labelled “T80” shows the number of discharge/charge cycles needed for the cell to reach 80% of its initial capacity, and is a measure of cycle life durability. Higher values in the T80 column indicate longer cycle life durability.	1
The present invention provides novel polymerase polypeptide and nucleic acid sequences. In some embodiments, the polypeptides further comprise a DNA binding domain, e.g., an Archaeal small basic protein, such as an Sso7d, Sac7d, or Sac7e DNA binding domain, which is fused to the polypeptide. The DNA binding domain typically increases the binding affinity of the enzyme to nucleic acid and can enhance the processivity of the polymerases.	1

Methods and apparatus for shielding circuitry from interference are provided.	1
This is achieved by means of a cushion including a flexible cover defining a chamber in which a water absorbing material is placed, said water absorbing material upon absorption of water being suitable for heating by means of microwaves, wherein the cover has a sealable feeding mouth so that water may be poured into the chamber. Hereby a heat cushion is obtained which is very compact and light-weight prior to appliance as the water absorbing core can be kept dry. This is an advantage as far as transport and distribution are concerned. Furthermore a sterile transfer of heat is achieved as the core and the water are sheathed by a cover after filling up. Furthermore the cushion can be manufactured from cheap material making the cushion suitable for disposable use, whereby the cushion does not have any of the unhygienic disadvantages of heat cushions for multiple appliances. In addition the cushion needs not to be wiped off prior to use. In some cases, however, it can be necessary to dab the cushion dry. Of course, the heat cushion may also be used to cool down a body part, for instance by filling the cushion with water and putting it in the freezer prior to us.	1
The present invention provides a method and preform for forming a structural assembly that defines a complex contour. The preform and, hence, the structural assembly includes first and second skin members and a cellular core member between the skin members. The skin members and/or the core member can be formed to a shape that corresponds to the desired contour of the structural member before the preform is assembled, e.g., by superplastic forming. Thus, complex contours that would be difficult or impossible to form from a flat preform can be produced.	1
According to another aspect of the invention, the cell holding portions may be provided at positions that are symmetrical in the longitudinal direction with respect to a center of the battery cell. For this reason, the battery cell can be held in good balance.	1
The object of the present invention is to provide a resistance generating device for a training bicycle which can impart an increased resistance force to a wheel of the training bicycle in response to a higher rotation speed of the wheel.	1
The band can be formed from a polymeric material which can be tightly fitted to the expansion mechanism. The band can be an elastic material that can be expanded to position the band about the expansion mechanism and thereafter allowed to contract to engage the expansion mechanism for resisting its expansion. Alternatively, the band can be a material that can contract such as by the application of heat. Thus, the material can be a tube which is heat shrinkable, such that the tube prior to shrinking can be of a diameter greater than the external surface of the expansion mechanism for ease of fitting to the expansion mechanism and once properly positioned, heat can be applied to the tube to shrink it into tight engagement with the expansion mechanism. Application of the heat can advantageously, be as simple as by a hand held heat gun.	1
Apparatuses, articles, processes for manufacture, garments, bustiers, breast pumping bras, and nursing bras that provide support to a wearer and/or at least a portion of a breast pump to aid with milk expression using a breast pump are described. For example, a garment, such as a bra, a tank top, or a bustier, may provide support for the weight of a breast pump body, milk container, and/or a wearer's breast, help secure the breast pump body in place, and/or stabilize the breast pump body for milk expression. Various embodiments may provide support to aid with creation of a tight seal between the wearer's breast and at least a portion of a breast pump body for milk expression (e.g., a breast shield and/or a let-down cushion of a breast pump body). The wearer of the garment may be able to pump breast milk without having to manually hold the breast pump body against themselves.	1
According to the present invention, a holder covers the bottom and sides of an electron gun cathode, while the tip of the electron gun cathode protrudes from the holder. With this configuration, emission of electrons and electron gun cathode material from the sides of the electron gun cathode can be reduced, so that the life of the electron gun can be extended.	1
In another embodiment, the ratchet teeth are not necessary as the frequency of discharge at the electrodes 16 is altered such that pressure in the fluid 18 accumulates at a rate similar to that of a power charge in the prior art E-4 device. More specifically, the discharge frequency is such that pressure generated in a discharge event is not dissipated as subsequent discharge events are occurring. The frequency of pulses is controlled to build and then maintain a substantially constant pressure. The exact time required to set a specific tool depends on a number of factors such as the complexity of the tool being set, the hydrostatic pressure in the immediate vicinity of the tool being set and the temperature of the well, especially in the vicinity of the tool being set. As the complexity of the tool increases, the setting time increases; as hydrostatic pressure increases, the setting time increases; and as temperature increases the setting (or actuation) time decreases. For example, time factors for setting tools might be about 5-10 seconds for more simple tools in easier-to-set conditions while more complex tools that might be in harder-to-set conditions could have a time factor to set of about 40-60 seconds. It is important to recognize that these are only examples and that other times to set could be applicable for certain situations or constructions. The pulse arrangement disclosed herein allows for adaptation to these variables in the field and on-the-fly. Therefore, much greater control and accuracy of the setting process is obtainable using the method and arrangement disclosed herein.	1
In accordance with the present invention, a narrow band or loop formed of cloth or paper is provided and is formed entirely separately of the necktie and shirt. The loop can be made so inexpensively that it can, if desired, be a one use disposable item furnished without charge to the customer by dry cleaners, necktie manufacturers, or the like. The back of the loop has a buttonhole for engagement with any shirt button. The front exterior face of the loop carries a slightly tacky pressuresensitive adhesive.

In other words, after, in one inversion driving mode, a transition nucleus in which a liquid crystal alignment has changed from the splay alignment to the bend alignment is generated, by switching the inversion driving mode to a different inversion driving mode, and fluctuating the liquid crystal alignment so that a transition nucleus grows, a fact transition of the state of the liquid crystal alignment in a different pixel can be performed. At a time of transition of the liquid crystal alignment, by switching between an inversion driving mode in which a transition nucleus can easily be generated and an inversion driving mode in which an alignment state of one pixel can easily be conducted to different pixels, with the transition nucleus as a base, merits of the one and different inversion driving modes can be combined. Accordingly, compared with the case of applying voltages to pixels on the basis of one inversion driving mode so that a transition of the alignment state of liquid crystal can be performed, the time required for initial transition can be reduced without using additional members.	1

The present disclosure overcomes the aforementioned limitations with Software Defined Networking systems and methods using a Path Computation and Control Element (PCCE). The PCCE is based in part on a Path Computation Element (PCE) with additional functionality of a centralized entity controlling the initiation of new connections or tunnels and managing the state of the connections or tunnels once established. In particular, extensions are provided to the PCE architecture to allow a centralized application or applications to control the creation, rerouting and deletion of connections within a network. Compared to other mechanisms such as OpenFlow, the centralized controller is free from interacting with each node in the connection (instead relying on the signaling intelligence in each node for distributed creation of the connection). Because it is based in part on PCE technology, the PCCE takes advantage of PCE infrastructure that has already been standardized, tested and implemented as an interface to network elements.	1

FIG. 2A-2C illustrate that the macroporous body lattice 120 may be designed through the use of software including optimization algorithms that tailor the structure based upon loading conditions imparted upon the implant, including: compression, shear, and torsion 111 (see arrows in FIG. 2B). Similarly, the micro- and/or body lattice structures 110 , 120 may be functionally-graded with respect to pore size, strut thickness, and/or surface roughness. The microporous endplate 110 may be functionally graded in a superior to inferior direction, in a medial to lateral direction, or a combination of superior-to-inferior and medial-to-lateral. According to one embodiment, the porosity of the upper and lower bone contacting surfaces 101 , 102 may be functionally graded to allow for the transition from micro- to macro lattice to be continuous. Alternatively, the transition from microporous endplate to macroporous body lattice may be distinct. Furthermore, gradation of the stiffness of the microporous endplate would allow the areas in contact with the bone to deflect and deform to better conform to the unique vertebral endplate morphology of an individual patient. This allows for the dual benefit of distributing load and reducing the possibility of subsidence.	1
Exemplary embodiments disclosed herein can provide a switching chamber of the type mentioned at the outset which can be manufactured using simple means and with a high level of fitting accuracy.	1
In some embodiments, dividers may be positioned inside the volume of a pressure vessel to increase the heat transfer area at heat transfer surfaces, both liquid and solid, of the pressure vessel and air that is being compressed and/or expanded. Methods to increase heat transfer surface area contemplated include the use of fluid to solid and fluid to fluid. Each of the dividers may be shaped and/or may be positioned to trap a volume or pocket of air within a pressure vessel that provides one or more air/liquid interfaces in addition to an interface between the divider and the air (i.e., air/divider interface). The air/liquid interfaces and air/divider interfaces provide surfaces across which heat may be transferred during compression and/or expansion. The dividers may be configured such that the area of the liquid through which heat is transferred, whether directly at air/liquid interfaces or indirectly through portions of a divider at air/divider interfaces, may remain substantially constant, even toward the end of a compression cycle, when only small volumes of air may remain in a pressure vessel. Maintaining large surface areas for heat transfer toward the end of compression may improve efficiency during compression, as this portion of the compression process, absent heat removal, typically experiences the greatest rise in temperature and greatest impairment to compression efficiency. It is to be appreciated that, toward the end of compression, an incremental change in the volume available for air may cause the greatest percent change in the overall volume that is available for air, and consequently, may be associated with a greater change in temperature, absent heat removal. Similar effects may be realized by maintaining a relatively large area for heat transfer to air from liquid and/or the dividers throughout and particularly at the beginning of an expansion cycle.	1

According to the invention, a series emitter-follower voltage regulator including a transistor and a Zener diode is connected between a power supply filter capacitor and an integrated circuit. The power supply includes a transformer having a full wave bridge rectifier connected across a portion of a secondary winding. A filter capacitor is connected across the rectifier and between the collector of the voltage regulator transistor and ground. The power supply further includes a rectifier connected to the secondary winding of the transformer for feeding half wave rectified charging current to a small capacitor which is connected to ground and across a resistor voltage divider. A junction of the voltage divider is connected to the base of the regulator transistor and through a Zener diode to ground. The emitter of the regulator transistor is connected to the integrated circuit. The filter capacitor is sufficiently large so that a charge can be stored for very long periods of time to guarantee the availability of a smooth D.C. upon the reapplication of power, while the small capacitor is sufficiently small so that discharging thereof via the resistor voltage divider is rapid and quickly causes an insufficient current flow to the base of the transistor to maintain the transistor in conduction. The transistor is therefore quickly cut off and removes power from the integrated circuit. The low value of this small capacitor also provides for a rapid charging thereof so that reapplication of power effects a rapid and sufficient current delivery to the base of the regulator transistor to turn on the transistor and maintain the same conductive up to the next loss of power to the power supply.	1
The increasing load on the coupling device and the progressive collapse of the central region of the back ferrule is believed to slowly seat the components and increase the accuracy of the axial alignment.

In order to reduce the stream buffer size in encoder or reduce the reconstruction buffer in decoder, the encoder compresses only one part of slice 0 before switching to slice 1 according to the present invention. The decoder can also de-compress only partial data of one slice before switching to another slice. Thus, the corresponding stream buffer or frame buffers of slice 0 is designed for storing only partial data of slice 0 . When the decoding of slice 0 starts before the decoding of slice 1 , the reconstruction buffer may store partial reconstructed data of slice 1 for decoding these two slices in parallel. Therefore, the frame buffer compression method according to the present invention can reduce the stream buffer size on encoder and reconstruction buffer on decoder.	1

In the first embodiment, the baud rate and the modulation scheme are defined as the operation mode. However, it is also possible to define the transmission rate and the modulation scheme as the operation mode or to define the transmission rate as the operation mode. When the transmission rate and the modulation scheme are defined as the operation mode, the operation mode table 151 has columns of transmission rate, modulation scheme and operation mode notification signal. For example, in the step S 34 , the operation mode control unit 160 judges whether or not the transmission rate of the second operation mode is higher than the transmission rate of the first operation mode. When the transmission rate of the second operation mode is higher than the transmission rate of the first operation mode, the operation mode control unit 160 changes the transmission rate of the second operation mode to the transmission rate of the first operation mode in the step S 35 . Further, in the step S 26 , the operation mode control unit 160 transmits information F 1 to the clock switching unit 143 . The information F 1 includes the transmission rate. The clock switching unit 143 selects an oscillator generating the clock signal at the frequency based on the information F 1 from the oscillators 144 a , 144 b and 144 c . The clock switching unit 143 switches the oscillator from the oscillator 144 a to the selected oscillator. The oscillator selected by the clock switching unit 143 outputs the clock signal to the A/D conversion unit 141 b.	0

The present invention can be realized in a number of ways to retard or eliminate myopia. Principally, an optical vision correction device is designed with the necessary amount of refractive power to correct central vision to which a prescribed amount of suitable off-axis or peripheral aberrations, in particular relative curvature of field, is incorporated. This off-axis peripheral aberration or relative curvature of field, introduced together with the appropriate refractive power is precisely manipulated so that, in combination with the existing ocular aberrations, the image at the peripheral field is positioned more anteriorly than the corresponding position of the peripheral retina while the central image is positioned at or near the fovea. Typically, due to the presence of radial astigmatism (a type of peripheral, off-axis aberration), two line foci are associated with the peripheral image (the interval between the two line foci is called the “interval of Sturm” which also includes the “circle of least confusion”, a position along the interval of Sturm which produces the minimal focal spot diameter and is generally considered the position of best equivalent focus). In the presence of radial astigmatism, the curvature of field introduced according to the present invention (together with the appropriate refractive power) is manipulated so that, in combination with the ocular aberrations, at least the more anterior line focus associated with radial astigmatism is positioned more anteriorly than the peripheral retina so that a part of, or in some cases the entirety of, the interval of Sturm lies in front of the peripheral retina while the central image is positioned at or near the fovea.	0

Four processes were run with their voltage and percentage oxalic acid concentrations with the resulting geometrical parameters of typical aluminum oxide structures formed by the above discussed techniques shown in Table 1. The physical data of the porous oxide film produced were measured by electron micrographs. The temperature of the electrolyte in all four of the processes rose to 8° centigrade during the last thirty minutes of the 2 hours of anodization. This temperature was tolerable, but any rise above this temperature generally resulted in burning of the films.	0

In one embodiment of the present invention, a user interface is provided by which a human operator may enter event meta-data. For example, a user interface is provided for a security officer to monitor one or more cameras. The cameras automatically generate meta-data, as noted above. In addition, the human operator may add meta-data manually. For example, if the human operator observes suspicious activity going on in a particular camera, the human operator may add meta-data corresponding to suspicious activity. The human operator may select from a set of possible meta-data, as well as add “free-form” meta-data by typing into a text-entry box. For example, a human operator may transcribe speech in the video data. The transcribed speech serves as meta-data to the video data.	0

The foregoing and other objects, features, and advantages of the present disclosure set forth herein will be apparent from the following description of particular embodiments of those inventive concepts, as illustrated in the accompanying drawings. It should be noted that the drawings are not necessarily to scale; however the emphasis instead is being placed on illustrating the principles of the inventive concepts. Also, in the drawings the like reference characters may refer to the same parts or similar throughout the different views.

In one exemplary embodiment, the nanoparticle suspension was prepared by adding 0.3 grams of alumina nanoparticles, 1.0 mmol of Fe(NO 3 ) 3 .9H 2 O, and 0.3 mmol of MoO 2 (acac) 2 to 300 mL of DI water (18 MΩ-cm). Prior to being deposited on the substrate 10 , the nanoparticle catalyst solution is stirred for twenty-four hours and sonicated for one hour. Use of water as the solvent to dissolve the transition metal catalyst provides an advantage over current techniques. Most current systems use a polar solvent such as methanol (CH 3 OH) to dissolve the nanoparticle catalysts. These systems therefore require polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) to be used as the patterning material to prevent it from dissolving under the polar solvent of the catalyst solution. This procedure requires the use of expensive lithography. In contrast, use of water as the solvent allows for patterning using standard optical lithography thereby creating a more cost-efficient means of synthesizing nanotubes 50 .	0
In some embodiments, the radio frequency generation module 230 may be configured as follows: when an absolute value of a difference between the temperature of the object to be processed and a preset temperature constant value is greater than or equal to a first temperature difference threshold, the working power is a rated power; when the absolute value of the difference between the temperature of the object to be processed and the preset temperature constant value is less than the first temperature difference threshold and greater than or equal to a second temperature difference threshold, the working power is 50 to 60% of the rated power, such as 50%, 55% or 60%; when the absolute value of the difference between the temperature of the object to be processed and the preset temperature constant value is less than the second temperature difference threshold, the working power is 20 to 30% of the rated power, such as 20%, 25% or 30%. The first temperature difference threshold is greater than the second temperature difference threshold. In the present embodiment, the preset temperature constant value may be −4 to −2° C., such as −4° C., −3° C. or −2° C. The rated power of the radio frequency generation module 230 may be 100 to 150 W.	0

Producing more uniform prepregs with less thickness irregularity is preferable and critical to overall product quality. In order to achieve this, it is necessary to open (i.e., spread) the reinforcing fiber bundle before impregnating it with a matrix resin when forming a prepreg, for reducing the thickness of the reinforcing fiber bundle and for letting the matrix resin sufficiently fill the clearances between the single fibers of the reinforcing fiber bundle.	0

Another type of garage door are panel or sectional doors. With reference to FIG. 3, the panel or sectional door 121 is typically made of many horizontal planar panels 123 that are coupled together with hinges 125 that allow the door 121 to travel along a track 124 mounted behind the frame into an open space in the ceiling. The panel or sectional door 121 is flexible out-of-plane at the bending sections hinges 125 but has strength in the plane of the door 121 when it is closed. If the horizontal force is applied to the top panel, the force is transmitted sequentially through the hinges 125 to the adjacent lower panels. The hinges 125 typically allow for some horizontal movement, thus all of panels 123 will shift towards the left until the hinge 125 will not allow any additional movement.	0
