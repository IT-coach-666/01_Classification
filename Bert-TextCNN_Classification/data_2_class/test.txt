They are furthermore resistant to chemicals such as mineral oil, halogenated diphenyl materials, and the like.	1
Being an aqueous additive, the glycolic acid is typically added to the wash water in the desalter. This improves distribution of the acid in the oil although addition to the aqueous phase should not be viewed as a requirement for the composition of the invention to work.	1
In accordance with the present invention, a partial task surgical simulator (training aid device) is provided for simulating the wounds and injuries on a role player, actor or model that could be received by a person during a trauma event. Specifically, the device includes a raiment fitting over strapped vests that are dimensioned to cover the torso of a person and therefore be worn by a person in a simulation. Further, the raiment can extend over the person's shoulders and upper arms, as well as over his/her groin area and upper thighs. Structurally, the raiment is made primarily of silicone and nylon fiber, and it is formed as a layer having an inner surface and an outer surface, with the outer surface having a color and a texture that is comparable to human skin. The vest is designed to fit under the raiment and on the torso of a body. Structurally, the vest is made primarily of silicone, nylon fiber, plastic and rubber materials, and it is formed as a shield portion covering the front and side of the torso held in place by straps. The vest provides a protective layer between the raiment and the model or actor. The vest is further designed to provide a detail of the internal structure of a human body, such as the rib cage and internal organs. The vest forms a cavity generally under and below the rib cage in which such prosthetic internal organs can be placed. The importance of the invention is that the simulator presents first responders with realistic-looking, dynamic medical effects that can simulate and mimic a plurality of different wounds and injuries.	1
Advantageously, the Direct Focus Feedback Auto Focus (DFF AF) system operates on a closed loop principle using the peak autocorrelation of the contrast AF derivation as a feedback signal for confirming the position of best focus that the taking lens is driven toward by the motor drive signal derived by parallax AF processing of the first and second signal sets. This feedback and confirmation increases accuracy and reduces AF sensitivity to noise/variation in design and manufacturing tolerances or environmental effects involving temperature, humidity and shock. Of course, this is in addition to the increase in accuracy obtained from two independent estimators of focus error--the range of the object and the maximal peak autocorrelation magnitude.	1
It is another aspect of the present invention to provide a camera case that positions the stored camera for easy removal. Embodiments of the present invention are integrated into a backpack such that the cradle is positioned adjacent a bottom portion of the backpack. Hinged opening features are provided for ease of access.	1
Further, it is advantageous when a drilling liquid exiting the double drill pipe assembly at the drill head-side end thereof is directed through the drill head to the front end opposite to the drill pipe-side end of the drill head and exits the drill head thereat. As a result, excavated earth can be transported and removed by means of the rinsing liquid through the already made borehole. Thus, this drilling fluid also serves as a rinsing fluid. In addition, by using a suitable drilling liquid, a stabilization of the bore channel can be established. Preferably, a bentonite drilling fluid is used.	1
In a preferred embodiment, the present invention comprises a dual durometer, bonded direct fixation fastener for securing a rail onto a railroad bed utilizes a relatively soft elastomer between a rail plate and a bed plate. The soft elastomer will move in a vertical direction by action of the weight of a train. To prevent movement in the horizontal direction, the two plates have upturned outside edges, and the upturned edges are encased in a relatively hard elastomers. The two elastomers are bonded to the two plates, and the two rubbers are physically continuous. The soft elastomer achieves a desired amount of noise and vibration mitigation while the hard elastomer prevents lateral deflection and extends the useful life of the fastener.	1
Yet another advantage of the present bio-waste disposal system is that the present bio-waste disposal system may require less water than a standard toilet.	1
In accordance with a presently preferred embodiment of the present invention a carpet after having been cut into a tile is preferably tip sheared or otherwise treated to provide an internal separation such as a stripe, track and/or design differentiating selected lower cut pile (side first portions) from the uncut or unselected pile (in internal second portions) separated by a discontinuity of the separation. The tip shearing process stops at the discontinuity which can provide a visible line parallel, or not, to the edge depending upon the orientation of the carpet relative to a cutting head during the cutting process. Parallel and/or intersecting effects may be provided using more than one cutting head and/or more than one pass. Programmable controllers and/or other positioners may be utilized to assist in positioning the cutting head and/or tile so that one or more designs can be cut or otherwise provided internal to edges of carpet tiles once cut from rolls of carpet.	1
As is apparent from the above description, according to the embodiments of the present invention, identification information of a specific carrier can be effectively transmitted according to carrier scheduling in a wireless communication system.	1
As can be seen, for the first three curves where data was collected or retrieved from the literature by the assignee of this application, the pump A-1 has far superior performance overall. The family of curves for the pump A-1 demonstrates higher maximum flow rates than either Convention Pump C or D. Comparable or larger flow rates are achieved with impeller speeds that are significantly less than that of the other pumps for which data was collected or available. For example, for Conventional Pump D the motor speed required to obtain the flow rate as charted was 45,000 RPM whereas the pump A-1 achieved comparable flows at only 19,000 RPM. As discussed herein, these lower impeller speeds for pump A-1 are expected to provide much superior patient outcomes at least because hemolysis and other potentially deleterious blood interactions at the impeller will be dramatically reduced.	1
The advantages related to the use of a double supplementary motor drive as defined in the second embodiment of the invention, derive mainly from the fact that in this way it is possible to use components of smaller dimensions, with limited size increase and obtaining at the same time a substantial cost reduction.	1
In the method of manufacturing a steel cord for rubber reinforcement according to the present invention, since a cobalt component is alloyed to the surface of a brass-plated steel wire through automatic attachment and compression during continuous drawing using an existing drawing process without adding a separate plating step, the adhesion between the plated steel wire and rubber can be improved without causing degradation of drawing machinability of the plated steel wire.	1
According to one or more embodiments, the disclosed methods and systems may guide a person to a specific distance from the object. According to one or more embodiments, the provided guidance may facilitate a user to undergo an eye exam without the need for technical or trained personnel to administer the test. As such, this disclosure opens up the potential for a range of people to receive an accurate eye exam who may have difficulty accessing an optician's office (those that are infirm, remote, etc.), or those who may prefer the convenience of self-administering an exam.	1
Further, according to the present invention, although the latching portion 16 is disengaged from the engaging device 27 of the needle bar, while the carriage 11 is ascending toward the upper dead point accompanied by the needle bar 26 at an initial stage of the stitch-skipping action, thereby allowing the needle bar 26 , now released from the engagement with the latching portion 16 , to keep ascending at the same pace until colliding with the positioning block 37 at the upper dead point, and to start descending because of reaction of the collision, the second latching portion 16 b of the carriage 11 , which reaches the upper dead point after the needle bar 26 , sustains the first engaging portion 27 a of the needle bar 26 just about to start descending, thereby inhibiting the reactive motion of the needle bar 26 and thus immediately stopping the needle bar 26 at the position corresponding to the upper dead point.	1
Another object of the Bed Bug and Roach Trap is to provide a system that is relatively light in weight and easily repositioned from room to room to trap and kill nocturnal pests.	1
This harvest measuring system will allow farmers to monitor the yield as well as determine precise areas of the field where under production present.	1
An exemplary, preferred material for the present invention are optical components that are based on or contain Ba(PO 3 ) 2 , 10 to 60 mol %; Al(PO 3 ) 3 , 10 to 60 mol %; BaF 2 +RFx, 20 to 90 mol % (where RFx is selected from the group MgF 2 , CaF 2 , BiF 3 ); and one of a dopant of Yb 2 O 3 of 0.5 to 20 weight % or fluoride YbF 3 of 0.5 to 20 weight %. The raw compounds used for glass formation are: Barium Metaphosphate, Ba(PO 3 ) 2 , and Aluminum Metaphosphate, Al(PO 3 ) 3 , which are considered chemically stable (durable) substances, resistant against dissolving in water or other moisture content (e.g., acidic or base).	1
In general, this disclosure is directed to a system with a single colour light source (including, but not limited to, a combination of red, green and blue light sources producing white light, and/or a lamp) and having a light distribution system configured to distribute light, from the light source, to a plurality of projectors for use in forming images for projection. In some implementations a blue laser can be used as the light source and the light distribution system can distribute blue laser light to colour conversion systems which converts the blue laser light to other colours, for example, red light and green light. Use of blue laser light as the source light, rather than a combination of light from red, green and blue lasers, results in a single electrical driver type, a single thermal management system, with single target cooling temperature, and a single optical path. The light distribution system can be agnostic to the colour of light and can be used to distribute white light, red light, green light, blue light and/or a combination thereof. The light distribution system can be configured to equally distribute light to a plurality of projectors, and/or colour conversion systems, by partitioning an image of an integrator into sub-areas with an etendue that is matched from the source to an optical fiber (and thus a corresponding projector). Alternatively, the light distribution system can be configured to distributed light to a plurality of projectors, and/or colour conversion systems, using tunable reflectivity/tunable transmission devices. Each light distribution described herein can achieve such respective functionality with little to no loss of light.	1
One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that, for the sake of brevity and clarity, various conventional features used in oxidation ovens have been omitted from the figures and the following description. Examples of such features include, without limitation, baffles, ducts, vanes, vents, and the like used to adjust the flow of gas within the oven 100 , vestibules and exhaust features to reduce the discharge of undesirable processes gases into the ambient environment, and/or insulation, louvers, and other thermal features to improve the thermal efficiency of the oven 100 . It is to be understood that the exemplary oven 100 shown in FIGS. 1-5 can include such features	1
Depending on the effect desired, the printing paste may contain colouring materials which are chemically stable to the discharging agent(s), and which are capable of being fixed to the fabric during the process of the present invention. Generally these colouring materials are dispersed pigments. To assist this fixation, agents may be present such as resin binders which are capable of polymerising to bind the colouring materials to the fabric. Acrylic or polyurethane resin emulsions have been found to be most suitable for this purpose. Catalysts which promote the curing of the binder or binders may also be present in the printing paste.	1
This patent specification provides a semiconductor wafer, a semiconductor device, and a method for manufacturing the semiconductor device which are capable of effectively suppressing a short circuit which can be caused by the probing operation with the probing pad.	1
Besides, the semiconductor single crystal manufacturing apparatus of the present invention is provided with plural collars, so that working accuracy can be assured in the production of the collars, and deformation due to a thermal influence at the time of pulling up can be suppressed from affecting on eccentric accuracy originally possessed by the wire at the time of the rotations of the crystal. And, the adjustment of the wire's exposed position depending on the temperature range becomes possible, and the control of the wire oxidation rate can be controlled.	1
According to the third aspect of the invention, the same effect as the first or second aspect of the invention can be obtained. In addition, since the thread-sliding piece is involved with the thread-sliding piece adjusting means further capable of individually adjusting the lateral position of the tip of the thread-sliding piece, fine adjustment of the darning width can be easily made without adjusting positions of the thread-sliding piece holder and lower knife holder in the above lateral direction. By combining adjusting means for the thread-sliding piece holder and the lower knife holder to move in the lateral direction, the adjustable range of the darning width can be further extended, and the operation of adjusting the darning width can be simplified, thereby improving the working efficiency.	1
The slant rig of the present invention can be trailer-mounted for easy transportation to and from well sites using standard trucks. Similarly, the various components of said rig including, without limitation, mud tanks, pumps, control equipment and crew quarters, can also be skid, track truck-mounted. As a result, said components can be efficiently and economically transported to and from well sites. Said components can also be quickly mobilized at a desired drilling location, and thereafter demobilized upon completion of operations.	1

In accordance with the present invention, two aeration types, i.e., macropore and micropore aeration, are combined within the membrane bioreactor. Macropore aeration functions to clean the membrane surface with both gas and water so as to reduce or eliminate the sedimentation of pollutants on the membrane surface. Micropore aeration serves to keep the concentration of dissolved oxygen at a required level. Utilizing micropore aeration apparatus thus allows for the concentration of dissolved oxygen to be comparatively higher than when macropore aeration apparatus is used exclusively. On the other hand, at the same oxygen utilization rate, the rate of aeration can be lower decreasing significantly the energy consumption. Therefore, the reactor is especially suitable for treating highly loaded organic waste water.	1
Preferably, the receiving means, comprises a tray, and the lid may to advantage be pivotally mounted on the tray.	1
It is another object of the present invention to provide an endoscopic clip removing apparatus that is compatible for manipulating surgical clips, especially those of asymmetric design and which are constructed from a polymeric material.	1
The foregoing method thus provides a relatively inexpensive way of manufacturing such curved surfaces without necessarily requiring special equipment or inordinately expensive machining equipment which is not otherwise routinely found in machine shops.	1
An engine includes at least one cylinder, an intake valve, a conduit, a positive displacement powdered fuel dispensing device, and an oxidizing gas source supplying an oxidizing gas to the conduit. The cylinder is defined by a cylinder block having a bore, a cylinder head coupled to the top of the cylinder block, and a piston received in the bore of the cylinder block. The intake valve is communicatively coupled with the cylinder head. The conduit is communicatively coupled with the intake valve. The positive displacement powdered fuel dispensing device is communicatively coupled with the conduit. The positive displacement powdered fuel dispensing device meters a supply of a powdered fuel including a substantially explosible powder such that the intake valve admits a powdered fuel dispersion including the substantially explosible powder dispersed in the oxidizing gas at an explosible ratio such that the powdered fuel dispersion is explosible.	1
The term single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), as used herein represents one of the most common forms of genetic variation. These polymorphisms occur when a single nucleotide (A, G, C or T) in the genome is altered. SNPs generally tend to be evolutionarily stable from generation to generation and, as such, can be used to study specific genetic abnormalities throughout a population. SNPs often occur in protein coding regions and, as a result, may lead to the expression of a defective or variant form of a protein. Such polymorphisms can therefore serve as effective indicators of genetic disease. However, not all SNPs are found in protein coding regions of the genome. Some SNPs are located in noncoding regions, but these polymorphisms may also lead to altered protein expression. Specifically, SNP sites in noncoding regions may, for example, lead to differential and defective splicing. In diseases where multiple genes may influence the onset of the disease, SNPs can be used as diagnostic tools for identifying individuals with a predisposition for manifesting the disease, genotyping the patients suffering from the disease in terms of the genetic causes underlying the condition, and facilitating drug development based on the insight revealed regarding the role of target proteins in the pathogenesis process.	1
A high reaching pruning apparatus is provided. The high reaching pruning apparatus has an elongated telescoping pole, a foot brace and a hook for grasping a tree limb. The high reaching pruning apparatus is suitable for easily pruning and trimming tall trees.	1
Satellite signals are inherently low power and can be disrupted or otherwise made unreliable. There have been numerous documented examples of disruptions and the results therefrom of the loss of such satellite signals. A terrestrial alternative or backup to the public GNSS systems can be advantageous to mitigate against short term or multi-day loss, disruption, or compromise of satellite services, including timing, navigation, and positioning services that are based on satellite signals.	1
The compositions of the present invention, namely, neurokinin-1 (NK-1) receptor antagonists in combination with an inhibitor of metachromatic cell activation, such as an anti-inflammatory agent, an immunosuppressor, or a kinase inhibitor, or a combination thereof, provide significant advantages over previously used compositions in reducing the side effect of the therapy as well as its cost.	1
A second continuing object of the invention is to provide a belt buckle that is easy to manufacture.	1
Yet another advantage of the present high reaching pruning apparatus is that the present high reaching pruning apparatus may telescopically expand.	1
One embodiment of an apparatus for arbitrating ownership of an interface between two hub agents is disclosed. The apparatus includes an arbitration signal output circuit to output a first request signal to indicate a data transfer and a data path input/output unit to output data to a data path during a period indicated by the arbitration signal. An intended advantage of the embodiment is to provide an efficient means of arbitrating ownership of a hub interface between two hub agents. An additional intended advantage of the embodiment is to provide a cost reduction through reducing the number of signals required to arbitrate for ownership of the hub interface and to frame data transfers on the hub interface.	1
It is furthermore preferred if the ribs provided on the outside of the tubes are longitudinal ribs, which preferably extend over the entire length of the tubes, thereby essentially over the entire length of the cooling radiator as a whole. It is particularly preferred if up to 15, extremely preferably up to twelve longitudinal ribs per tube are provided. In this connection, it is particularly preferred if the longitudinal ribs have a height, thereby an expanse from the outside of the tube in an outward direction, of up to 15 mm, preferably up to 12 mm. The spacing between the longitudinal ribs, relative to one another, should be up to 25 mm, preferably up to 20 mm, in order to thereby not only guarantee an active surface for the cooling radiator with great heat dissipation, but rather, at the same time, to also optimize the transfer of heat from the cooling medium to the ambient air that flows around and through the cooling radiator.	1
In accordance with the instant invention, a moisture stabilizing composition is provided that is characterized by a high rate of absorption in cellulosic fibrous material, and a low volatility. As a result, this composition can be applied to cellulosic sheet material in high speed machinery, with assurance that it will be absorbed quickly enough and in large enough amount to impart the degree of moisture stability desired for later processing of the sheet. It can also be applied to the cellulosic fibrous material before it is put in sheet form, such as to the cellulosic pulp, to the cellulosic fibers in the beater or in the furnish, or at any stage in the processing prior to or during sheet formation. In this event, the polyoxyethyleneoxypropylene glycol block polymer has the function of enhancing the moisture stabilizing effectiveness of the polyoxy alkylene glycol. Furthermore the strength of the treated paper will be greater than if the composition is added to cellulose material in sheet form.	1
At least one of the light sources includes a light guide disposed therein, and thus the three-dimensional lighting can be improved.	1
In other forms of the invention, the band can remain in place about the expansion mechanism as that mechanism is expanded. Thus, the invention includes a band that resists expansion of the expansion mechanism during any of storage and transport of the rock bolt, and during installation of the rock bolt into a bore, but which allows expansion of the expansion mechanism under an expansion load which is applied upon the rock bolt reaching the desired depth of penetration into the rock body. That expansion load can be a load which is applied by the drive arrangement which drives the rock bolt into the rock body and can be a load which is applied in a manner different to the load which drives the rock bolt into the rock body. Thus, the load applied by the band to resist expansion of the expansion mechanism can be high enough to prevent expansion during any of storage and transport of the rock bolt, and during installation of the rock bolt into a bore, but which is less than that applied to expand the expansion mechanism once installed. In this form of the invention, the band can be elastic or stretchable to allow the expansion mechanism to be expanded.	1
The invention relates generally to a traction system for a coiled tubing injector that relieves elastic strain in tubing as tubing passes through the gripping zone. Momentarily removing or reducing the normal force on a gripper at an intermediate location within a gripping zone, thus momentarily removing or reducing the axial force imparted by the gripper on the tubing, allows strain in at least the tubing to be relieved by relative motion of the gripper with respect to the tubing, without the injector losing traction as a whole on the tubing and allowing it to slip. When the normal force is reapplied the gripper again produces an axial force pulling on the tubing.	1
The inventors have discovered that the addition of glycolic acid (hydroxyacetic acid) and other water-soluble hydroxyacids to a crude oil can significantly reduce the amount of calcium and other metals and/or amines in the hydrocarbon when it is run through a desalter in a refinery. The inventors have compared the “normal” desalting on a reference crude oil containing higher than normal amounts of calcium and found minimal calcium removal. The addition of glycolic acid in levels of up to a 5:1 ratio with calcium, results in much lower metals and/or amine content of the desalted oil. The levels of metals other than calcium such as iron, zinc, silicon, nickel, sodium and potassium are also reduced. The removal of particulate iron in the form of iron oxide, iron sulfide, etc. is a specific, non-limiting embodiment of the invention. By “removing” the metals and/or amines from the hydrocarbon or crude is meant any and all partitioning, sequestering, separating, transferring, eliminating, dividing, removing, of one or more metal from the hydrocarbon or crude to any extent.	1
The quantity of n-dodecane extraction agent per se is not critical. The more n-dodecane extraction agent that is used, the better the separation. However, the capacity of the installation will drop with an increasing quantity of extraction agent. On the other hand, with too small of a quantity of extraction agent, the content of dichloroacetyl chloride in the distillate increases. Effectively, the ratio of n-dodecane extraction agent to distillate is from 5:1 to 30:1.	1
According to the cardboard box dividing device and the cardboard box production device of the present invention, a cardboard box is held at an appropriate pressure when cut, and thus the cardboard box can be stably cut and production precision can be improved.	1
A further object of the present invention is to provide an optical recording medium having the above-mentioned recording characteristics and a not-too-high laser power necessary to generate a recording mark.	1
The blade assembly is actuated by a hand-held crank lever which first rotate about a pivot axis parallel to and spaced from the longitudinal axis so as to radially displace the blades about the longitudinal axis to produce a ring cut all in response to an external torque applied to the hand crank. The clamping unit provides a support for the blade assembly and hand crank by means of a rotary unit having one end coupled to the support surface of the clamping unit and the opposite end operatively coupled to the hand crank. The rotary unit is configured with a spring or drag-induced assembly operative to prevent displacement of the rotary unit until the blade assembly engages the jacket. Once the jacket is engaged, a spring force preventing the rotation of the rotary member is overcome by the applied torque which initiates the rotation of the rotation member along with the hand crank and blades about the longitudinal axis.	1
The present invention achieves an improvement in the high-rate performance and an increase in the capacity of the electric double layer capacitor at lower manufacturing costs.	1
The pump A-2 is expected to provide even higher flow performance than that of pump A-1. The chart illustrates the expected H-Q performance at 22,000 RPM for a pump including the catheter assembly 400 . The improved performance relates to a transformation of the flow field coming off of the impeller 300 into a more laminar state from a more complex flow field. The transformation converts kinetic energy associated with a rotational component of the flow into additional pressure, enhancing the performance. This line suggests a number of possible improvements that could be implemented in the operation or configuration of the pump A-2. For example, if the impeller diameter is the same in the pump A-2 as in the pump A-1, the pump A-2 could operate at a lower RPM while providing the same output (flow rate) as that of the pump A-1. Or, if the pump A-2 is operated at the same speed as the pump A-1, the output could be higher with the pump A-2 for comparable amount of hemolysis.	1
An advantage of the present invention is to provide a bearing housing assembly and a drum-type washing machine with the same, in which the bearing housing assembly is formed by insert injection molding to improve durability of the drum-type washing machine and facilitate its assembly.	1
As will be apparent from the above, according to the aforementioned preferred embodiments, it is possible to provide a throttle control device and a vehicle in which an arithmetic processing for performing the control mode change is easy and a control mode change timing for the control mode change operation is clear.	1
Referring now to FIG. 2, a partial cross-sectional view of another embodiment of the up-drill apparatus 2 of the present disclosure will now be described. It should be noted that like numbers appearing in the various figures refer to like components. The apparatus 2 of FIG. 1 is similar to the apparatus 110 of FIG. 2 and some of the similarities will not be repeated. FIG. 2 further contains the rolling elements 112 , 114 interfaced between the stationary cam surface 82 and the rotating cam surface 34 . Rolling elements 112 , 114 may be referred to as rotating elements. In one preferred embodiment, rolling elements 112 , 114 may be spherical members such as stainless steel ball bearings or ceramic balls. A feature of this disclosure is that use of the rolling elements 112 , 114 allows for less of a direct impact on the stationary cam surface 82 and the rotating cam surface 34 when the surfaces 82 and 34 are interacting, which thereby produces less friction, abrasive wear, stress, and fatigue, which in turn increases the life of the surface 82 and surface 34 .	1
In summary, the testing and the calculations set out in Tables 1A-1D demonstrate that the condenser unit of the invention provides better results, and over a wider range of ambient temperatures, than are achievable using the corresponding assemblies of the prior art. The surprisingly good results are achieved by utilizing both variable condenser fan speed control and apportionment of the condenser, and by controlling the condenser unit so that it responds rapidly and precisely to changes in the ambient temperature.	1
The present invention is intended to overcome such a serious drawback and, to this end it provides a weft stop motion which is responsive to the running of the weft thread along the path between the weft supply bobbin and the weft thread inserter in a weaving loom of the shuttleless type, thus effectively cutting off the feeding of weft thread from the weft thread supply, any time the said running of the weft thread is stopped upon breaking of the weft thread being woven in the loom.	1
In one embodiment the product is a two ply product having only one embossed ply and having a sheet caliper from about 20 to about 40 mils. In another embodiment the fibrous structure product has enhanced roll firmness and the appearance of a more uniformly rolled product whereby the product has a Percent Compressibility from about 1.5% to about 4.5%	1
Yet another object of the invention is to create a billiard game that can improve one's billiard shooting skills. Playing alone allows a player to place the object balls in extremely difficult places or places in which the shooter does not shoot well. For example, a player might not be comfortable with rail shots, so one would place all five balls on different rails around the billiard table.	1
Thus, an injection system has been provided that facilitates more accurate metering of catalyst and reduces problems associated with bellows used in some injection systems of the prior art. Moreover, the inventive system is compatible with existing low pressure storage vessels and does not require expensive bellows to isolate the pressure vessel. Therefore the inventive system is substantially less expensive than the injection systems of the prior art.	1
One aspect of the invention features a method for treating or preventing BPD in an infant treated with pulmonary surfactant for respiratory distress syndrome (“RDS”). Following the treatment for respiratory distress syndrome with pulmonary surfactant, pulmonary surfactant is administered to the infant in an amount and for a time effective to treat or prevent the BPD. Typically, administration of the pulmonary surfactant for BPD is initiated after the treatment of the respiratory distress syndrome with pulmonary surfactant, for instance, at the next dosage interval following completion of the treatment for RDS, at day 3 of life of the infant, or whenever the treatment for RDS is completed. In certain embodiments, administration of the pulmonary surfactant is continued through at least 36 weeks post-menstrual age (“PMA”) of the infant or alternatively through at least 28 days post-natal age of the infant. In certain embodiments, administration of the pulmonary surfactant is continued through at least day 14 or day 18 of life of the infant. In certain embodiments, treatment is initiated anytime from day 3 of life of the infant to day 10 or even later, e.g., day 14 or 18 of life of the infant or later.	1
The methods of the invention can be free of chromatography steps. An advantage of excluding chromatography from one or more steps of the inventive methods includes significant reduction of the time in producing purified monoclonal antibodies in crystal form. Particular embodiments of the invention include those wherein no chromatography is carried out on a starting material or a resultant product of a recited step. Particular embodiments of the invention include those wherein no chromatography is carried out prior to the crystallization step.	1

With the aim of collaborating with our society and in the order to correcting the exposed problem, achieving the elimination of deficiencies and improving both productive and investment yields and costs of maintenance, there is a method widely studied by the applicant for the patent called FISH LIFT AND DESCENT DEVICE FOR SAVE THE OBSTACLES IN THE RIVERS, GENERATING ELECTRICAL ENERGY, which is described below.	1
The method according to the present invention serves for the operation of a wind farm with a multiplicity of wind energy plants, which are connected to a wind farm control unit, wherein each wind energy plant can perform a power reduction for purposes of maintenance or examination, and each one of the wind energy plants can perform the power reduction in response to a signal of the wind farm control unit, and the wind farm control unit co-ordinates the signals for the wind energy plants such that a power decrease of the wind farm does not exceed a predetermined amount and/or a provided power of the wind farm does not exceed a predetermined velocity of change, and wherein at all times at least one wind energy plant is not affected by the power reduction.	1
A further object of the invention is to create a challenging billiard game that does not utilize any racking device and is fast paced.	1
It is preferred if every submodule comprises up to twelve, preferably up to ten tubes. In this way, a cooling radiator is produced whose active surface can be adapted to the properties required for the cooling radiator with particularly simple means and, if necessary, around which the ambient air can flow completely.	1
Embodiments of the subject matter disclosed herein relate to an oil filter system for an engine system. The oil filter system may include a housing which is configured to receive a plurality of filter elements therein, e.g., the plurality of filter elements are disposed in the housing for operation of the engine system, but may be removed for servicing, replacement, or before the engine system is first put into service. The filter elements may trap particles within engine oil, removing the particles before the engine oil is sent to the engine. The housing may be supported by a frame. The frame may be configured to couple the oil filter to a desired vehicle structure as well as prevent the oil filter from experiencing a high level of movement or vibrations. Further, the frame may also be configured to support one or more vehicle sub-assemblies, such as fuel sub-assembly (including, for example, fuel filters, fuel pump, fuel-water separator, etc.) and an oil cooler sub-assembly. In this way, a common frame may be used to support not only the oil filter, but also the fuel sub-assembly and the oil cooler sub-assembly, eliminating the need for multiple, separate support frames and reducing the weight of the entire oil filter, frame, fuel, and oil cooler assembly.	1
It is an object of the present invention to solve these problems and to provide a process for shooting in the filling yarn in the case of warp knitting machines of the kind mentioned above, wherein the drawn off filling yarn is conserved as much as possible.	1
According to the present invention, in particular, even though the surplus spring force stored in the operating member return spring 85 is employed for returning the disengaged latching portion 16 to the engaging position C with the engaging device 27 , there is no likelihood that the driving force of the solenoid 73 is thereby affected at an initial stage of the disengagement of the latching portion 16 from the engaging device 27 (engagement sector T 1 ), since the corresponding energy is acquired by accumulating the extra driving force of the solenoid 73 for the disengagement sector T 2 in the operating member return spring 85 , and therefore both the engagement and disengagement of the latching portion 16 and the engaging device 27 of the needle bar can be quickly performed.	1
According to the present invention, the drying duct has at least one inlet end and at least two outlet ends. Consequently, air flow is increased, and therefore, drying time and power consumption are reduced.	1
In the above device, the first and second row right side collision sensors are connected to the controller via the first right side bus line, which is different from the second left side bus line for connecting the center collision sensor to the controller without increasing the number of bus lines. Further, the first and second row left side collision sensors are connected to the controller via the first left side bus line, which is different from the second left side bus line for connecting the center collision sensor to the controller without increasing the number of bus lines.	1
It is an object of the present invention to offer a linear light source, which can realize a document read apparatus, in which there is little illuminance differences in a depth direction with respect to a document arrangement glass, which serves as a document reading face, and in which even if the height (position or distance) of the document that serves as an object to be read is different, the differences of the light intensities that enter the image taking elements, such as CCDs, are small, and there is no big difference between the contrast of a copied image and the original document.	1
It is an object of the invention to automatically separate blood into its component phases by simply subjecting the self-contained assembly to centrifugal force so that upon completion of the centrifuging operation a sealing barrier separates the light phase from the heavy phase of the blood. The assembly is capable of withstanding rough handling through the mails, inversion of the container without remixing the component phases and preventing various chemical constituents in the heavy phase from leaking into and mixing with the light phase or vice versa. It is also an object of the invention to provide an assembly which is adapted for use in conjunction with other blood sampling devices for obtaining samples to be centrifuged without the necessity of employing special equipment. Another object of the invention is to pass the light phase of the blood through a pressure responsive valve-like diaphragm which also serves as a filter. It is a further object of the invention to provide a self-contained assembly for separating blood into its component parts which is inexpensive to manufacture, simple to assemble and easy to use.	1
In addition, an object is to provide an automatic bowling or skittle pin setter machine in which it is possible to select a variety of pin or skittle settings on the alley.	1
The mobility spectrum thus obtained is a smooth curve with a high mobility resolution that can only be obtained by the conventional pulse method using very narrow pulse widths of less than one hundred microseconds. But the pulse method produces strong noise on the peaks of the mobility spectrum, particularly with such narrow pulse widths, which is not the case with the modulation method according to the invention. The signal-to-noise ratio is improved by a factor of five at roughly the same mobility resolution; this also improves the detection sensitivity by a factor of five.	1
According to one aspect of the process of the invention, said first part of said soda liquor constitutes about ⅓ to ½ of the entire amount of soda liquor which participates in the reaction, whereas said second part of said soda liquor constitutes about ½ to ⅔ of the entire amount of soda liquor which participates in the reaction. By dividing the soda liquor into these two streams, there can be created a slurry of the burned lime and the first part of the soda liquor, which slurry, due to the short retention time of step (a), will not have time to completely undergo the exothermic reaction (1) above before it is pumped into the pressurized reaction vessel, where the reactions (1), (2) are completed. By preheating a second part of the soda liquor, preferably by indirect heat exchange against a product caustic soda (white liquor), the reaction rate is further speeded up so that the reactions can be completed in a very short period of time and in process equipment which is much smaller and less space requiring than in conventional systems.	1
The worm screw may axially pass through the second cavity and terminating within the female block such that the male block is maintained at a fixed spatial distance from the female block. The worm screw may further include a rectilinear shaft monolithically formed with the internal housing and a threaded distal end rotatably interfitted within the axial bore of the female block. Such an arrangement provides the unexpected and unpredictable advantage of using the worm screw to hold the male and female blocks in a locking arrangement instead of using conventional exposed lever locks which may be easily broken by an intruder.	1
A simpler process for changing configurations is provided that uses fewer hydraulic rams and fewer hydraulic circuits.	1
In one application of the invention, as shown in FIG. 2, the panels 10 are installed on the outside of a mobile home 22 . The panels 10 serve as a skirting that hides the equipment under the mobile home, such as axles and hydraulic supports. The installed panels 10 add elegance to the mobile home 22 and thus add the value of the home. The skirting also prevents rodents and other animals from finding habitat under the home. The building panels 10 can be secured to nailers on the bottom of the mobile home with fastening elements such as nails or screws.	1
Still another advantage of the present device is that a user may simply turn off the device and use the toilet as a regular toilet.	1
In the device according to the invention the controlled yarn brake of the known device has become superfluous, since now the measuring roller acts as a brake and as a thread clamp. Thereby at the same time the factor of inaccuracy and the velocity limiting factor, connected with such yarn brake, have been cancelled.	1
Advantageously, use of the teachings of the present invention increase the stub trace impedance thereby reducing the adverse affects of the stub traces on the quality of high frequency response signals.	1
The spine roll is designed with concave and convex curves that align accordingly with the curves of a neutral human spine/vertebral column. The spine roll has the ability to restore/realign each neutral curve from its extreme or diminished status. The spine roll has the ability to restore neutral alignment, which could help decrease stress/load on its elements caused by for example poor posture.	1
In accordance with another aspect of the invention, a hydraulic crimping tool crimping die is provided comprising a first section adapted to be removably connected to a die mounting area of a hydraulic crimping tool, and a second section comprising a crimping surface adapted to crimp a connector onto a conductor. The crimping die comprises an electrically insulating material at a majority of an exterior surface of the die which is adapted to prevent electrical arcing with the die.	1
Some embodiments may have adjustable straps that may be selectively attached to the garment, such as a garment with a top line on the garment with corresponding attachment mechanisms to that found on a strap thereby allowing the strap to be attached thereto. For example, the top line may be a piece of material (e.g., an elastic band) attached to an edge of a panel (e.g., an inner panel) and the corresponding attachment mechanisms may be sewn to the garment with stitching between the elastic band and the fabric of the garment. The one or more attachment mechanisms (e.g., corresponding attachment mechanisms to the attachment mechanisms found on the strap) may be sewn in to the garment for selectively attaching a strap in one of a plurality of positions to support a breast pump body.	1
In at least one aspect, the present invention relates to a seal assembly for sealing a wellbore. The wellbore has a pipe therein for the passage of fluid therethrough and a blowout preventer (BOP) positionable about the pipe. The seal assembly has a plurality of blocks positionable within the BOP, at least one actuator for selectively moving the blocks to a contact position surrounding the pipe of the wellbore, and a plurality of pipe seals for creating a seal about the pipe of the wellbore. The seals are carried by the blocks. At least one of the pipe seals in each block is selectively extendable therefrom for sealing engagement about the pipe after the blocks is moved to the contact position whereby the plurality of pipe seals is prevented from extending between the blocks as the blocks are moved to the contact position.	1
An object of the present invention is to define a dispenser head of that type that has improved sealing and fixing functions. In addition, the shutter and/or the body must be easy to mold and to remove from their molds. Permanent fixing is also another object. To achieve these objects, the present invention proposes, in one embodiment, for the fixing means to comprise at least one fixing profile facing radially outwards relative to the outlet axis X, and for the holding means to comprise at least one holding profile facing radially inwards towards the outlet axis X. This means that the shutter is fixed to the body over an outside periphery of the shutter and over an inside periphery of the body, unlike the fixing in the above-mentioned prior art dispenser head. According to another advantageous characteristic which may be implemented additionally or alternatively, the seal-receiving means are situated radially closer to the outlet axis X than the holding means. Advantageously, the seal-receiving means and the holding means extend substantially concentrically. This means that the fixing means are separated in space from the sealing means. In other words, the fixing means do not normally participate in sealing between the shutter and the body. Likewise, the sealing between the shutter and the body does not participate in fixing the shutter to the body. Thus, the sealing function and the fixing function are dissociated. It is thus possible to optimize each function (sealing and fixing) independently from each other. This does not apply to the prior art dispenser head in which the fixing participates in the sealing. Configuring the fixing profiles on the outside periphery of the shutter and separating the sealing function from the fixing function are two characteristics that can be implemented independently from each other.	1
Another object of the present invention is to provide composite structural members which can be connected to each other without using additional connection members or connection apparatus and thanks to this, which provide substantially rigid buildings to be built.	1
Methods, apparatus and computer program products are therefore provided for monitoring compliance in reporting unclaimed property. In one embodiment, potential non-reporters and potential under-reporters are separately identified such that an audit or other follow-up procedure may be conducted to ensure compliance. With respect to identifying potential under-reporters, methods, apparatus and computer program products of one embodiment conduct a multi-level review in order to more comprehensively identify potential under-reporters. As a result of the methods, apparatus and computer program products of the present invention, compliance in reporting unclaimed property may increase, both as a result of further education of the reporting entities and the deterrent effect of being identified as a potential non-reporter or a potential under-reporter, which may subject an entity to an audit or other follow-up procedure.	1
A shade cover attached to the bow rails and stanchions of a boat shields the bow from the sun and keeps the cabin below deck substantially cooler, thus a more comfortable temperature is maintained in the cabin for the enjoyment of the occupants. An ecologically-conscious benefit results with the use of the shade cover, because air conditioners would be used less to cool the cabin temperature, generators to run the air conditioners would be used less, fewer hours used on the generators to operate the air conditioner, and less fuel would be used to run the generators. The gel coat, which maintains the integrity of the fiberglass on the deck, would be protected from the sun by the shade cover. The properties of textiles engineered for tension membrane structures and solar screens are ideal for the boat bow shade cover application, because the open-weave or knitted mesh prevent water pooling; have excellent strength to weight ratios; favorable tensile strength; resistant to tearing; and are UV stabilized. Though solar screens were the inspiration for the invention, weather resistant, non-porous textiles function effectively as a heat sink, solar deflector, and gel coat protector.	1
A further object of the present invention is to provide a positioning apparatus for steelmaking lances of an electric arc furnace allowing an easy maintenance of the EAF which typically consists in removing and replacing the furnace that is typically made of two parts that are the upper shell of the EAF (generally composed of water cooled panels) and of the vessel of the EAF (or refractory lining of the lower shell).	1
The invention increases convenience of play because it is both effective and familiar. Convenience is increased because problems are minimized that are commonly associated with card games that involve columns of cards where both the suit and value of the cards are desirably visible to a player. Because the suit and value are on a horizontal line at the top of each card, the length of columns can be minimized. This is particularly advantageous for visually impaired players using a pack of cards with enlarged indicia. Also, some embodiments of the invention are familiar since indicia of similar shapes and designs can be still be used. Moreover, the fanning advantages of known packs of cards are retained with further inclusion of second indicia in positions vertically adjacent to first indicia.	1
The invention is directed to a sequencing system and method for increasing machine capacity and throughput. In an aspect of the invention, the sequencing system and method increases .machine capacity and throughput of mail pieces such as packages, flats, mixed mail and the like (generally referred hereinafter as product). The system and method also significantly reduces processing times for sequencing the products in delivery point sequence using, in an embodiment, parallel processing. Other applications such as warehousing and storage applications are also contemplated for use with the invention.	1
The plunger may be actuated by a cam or lever which may be driven by a manual crank, a manual lever, an electric motor, a linear actuator, or some other driver. The actuation system may be mounted to sliding members, the movement of which may be resisted by spring force. This may allow the actuation system to retract when the magazine is full or if there is resistance from some other source, such as a jammed round of ammunition. Movement of the plunger may be mechanically linked to the shuttle, so that when the plunger is actuated, the shuttle is actuated simultaneously, causing the shuttle and the plunger to act in reciprocal motion, either in phase with one another or opposite one another. Each may be returned from the actuation stroke by mechanical linkage, springs, gravity, or some other return.	1
Advantageously, it has been found that when a first joist is connected to a second joist according to an embodiment of the method, the ability of the bottom flange of an ‘I’ joist to rotate relative to the web of the ‘I’ joist is greatly reduced.	1

A player's strategy in poker is often greatly affected by whether the game is limit, pot-limit, or no-limit. In limit poker, for example, it is much easier to stay in the game longer to see more cards since there is a known limit to how much this will cost. In pot-limit, on the other hand, it is more difficult to adopt this strategy since it can be far more costly to stay in the game. Finally, in no-limit, it is possible at any moment, with no notice, for a player to be forced to commit all of his or her chips in order to remain in the game. For this reason, bluffing is much more effective in no-limit than in any other form of poker based on more limited wagering. Some poker players strongly prefer the relative cost certainty of limit poker, while other poker players prefer the brinksmanship of no-limit poker.	0

The cross ribs 2 and 3 can also be secured to the broad sides of the rectangular section. One example of this is shown in FIG. 4 in which the rectangular section indicated by reference numeral 4', in contrast with the rectangular section 4, has in cross section an enlarged broad side. The cross ribs 2 and 3 are welded to one broad side of the rectangular profile 4'. The cross ribs 2 and 3 are in the region of the rectangular profile 4' bent out in a plane perpendicular to the plane of the plate, and in particular in further continuance of the existing curving of the cross ribs 2 and 3. It would however be possible so to bend the cross ribs 2 and 3 in the region of the rectangular section 4' that their ends show an opposite direction to the direction illustrated in FIG. 4. The rectangular section 4' projects in the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 4 on both sides beyond the plane of the plate. It can accordingly be provided on both sides with bores 5 and 5'. A connection of several plate-shaped reinforcing elements is thus possible on both sides of the plane of the plate, according to which side is most accessible.	0

Sso7d and Sso7d-like proteins, Sac7d and Sac7d-like proteins, e.g., Sac7a, Sac7b, Sac7d, and Sac7e are small (about 7,000 kd MW), basic chromosomal proteins from the hyperthermophilic archaebacteria Sulfolobus solfataricus and S. acidocaldarius , respectively. These proteins are lysine-rich and have high thermal, acid and chemical stability. They bind DNA in a sequence-independent manner and when bound, increase the T M of DNA by up to 40° C. under some conditions (McAfee et al., Biochemistry 34:10063-10077, 1995). These proteins and their homologs are typically believed to be involved in stabilizing genomic DNA at elevated temperatures. Suitable Sso7d-like DNA binding domains for use in the invention can be modified based on their sequence homology to Sso7d. Typically, DNA binding domains that are identical to or substantially identical to a known DNA binding protein over a comparison window of about 25 amino acids, optionally about 50-100 amino acids, or the length of the entire protein, can be used in the invention. The sequence can be compared and aligned for maximum correspondence over a comparison window, or designated region as measured using one of the described comparison algorithms or by manual alignment and visual inspection. For purposes of this patent, percent amino acid identity is determined by the default parameters of BLAST.	0

In some embodiments, the retro scan is performed on an elliptical cross section (e.g., elongated) energy beam. The retro scan can be performed, with any cross section of the irradiating energy (e.g., transforming energy beam) disclosed herein. For example, the retro scan can be performed using an elliptical cross section e.g., using the astigmatism mechanism). For example, the retro scan can be performed using a circular cross section (e.g., focused, defocused; having small or large FLS). FIG. 23 shows an example of an astigmatism system for forming an elongated energy beam. The astigmatism system (e.g., FIG. 23, 2300) may be coupled to the 3D printer. The astigmatism system may be disposed adjacent (e.g., in, or outside of) the processing chamber in which the transforming energy beam generates the 3D object (e.g., FIG. 1, 126). The astigmatism system may be operatively coupled to an energy source, and/or to a controller. At least one element of the astigmatism system may be controlled before, after, and/or during at least a portion of the 3D printing (e.g., in real time). At least one element of the astigmatism system may be controlled manually and/or automatically (e.g., using a controller). The energy source may irradiate energy (e.g., FIG. 23, 2305 depicting an energy beam). The astigmatism system may be used to form an elongated cross-sectional beam (e.g., narrow, and/or long, FIG. 23, 2340) that irradiates the target surface (e.g., 2335 ). The energy beam may be elongated along the X-Y plane (e.g., FIG. 23). At times, the footprint of the energy beam may be elongated by an energy beam perforation (e.g., an elongated slit) that the energy beam may be allowed to pass through. At nines, the movement of the energy beam may be controlled to perform a scan or a retro scan to form an elongated energy beam footprint.	0

Upon completion of a CPT cleavage reaction, the uncleaved scissile probes can be removed or neutralized prior to detection of cleaved probes to avoid false positive signals, if desired. This can be done in any of a variety of ways including, for example, attachment of the probes to a solid support prior to cleavage such that following the CPT reaction, cleaved probes that have been released into solution can be physically separated from uncleaved probes remaining on the support. Uncleaved and cleaved probes can also be separated based on differences in length, capture of a particular binding label or sequence using, for example, methods described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,355,431.	0

Examples of algorithms that are suitable for determining percent sequence identity and sequence similarity are the BLAST and BLAST 2.0 algorithms, which are described in Altschul et al. (1990) J. Mol. Biol. 215: 403-410 and Altschuel et al. (1977) Nucleic Acids Res. 25: 3389-3402, respectively. Software for performing BLAST analyses is publicly available through the National Center for Biotechnology Information (ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). This algorithm involves first identifying high scoring sequence pairs (HSPs) by identifying short words of length W in the query sequence, which either match or satisfy some positive-valued threshold score T when aligned with a word of the same length in a database sequence. T is referred to as the neighborhood word score threshold (Altschul et al, supra). These initial neighborhood word hits act as seeds for initiating searches to find longer HSPs containing them. The word hits are then extended in both directions along each sequence for as far as the cumulative alignment score can be increased. Cumulative scores are calculated using, for nucleotide sequences, the parameters M (reward score for a pair of matching residues; always >0) and N (penalty score for mismatching residues; always &#x3c;0). For amino acid sequences, a scoring matrix is used to calculate the cumulative score. Extension of the word hits in each direction are halted when: the cumulative alignment score falls off by the quantity X from its maximum achieved value; the cumulative score goes to zero or below, due to the accumulation of one or more negative-scoring residue alignments; or the end of either sequence is reached. The BLAST algorithm parameters W, T, and X determine the sensitivity and speed of the alignment. The BLASTN program (for nucleotide sequences) uses as defaults a wordlength (W) of 11, an expectation (E) of 10, M=5, N=−4, and a comparison of both strands. For amino acid sequences, the BLASTP program uses as defaults a wordlength (W) of 3, an expectation (E) of 10, and the BLOSUM62 scoring matrix (see Henikoff & Henikoff, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:10915 (1989)).	0
A first aspect of the present invention is to provide a combination machining lathe which comprises: a workpiece holding device configured to hold a workpiece in a manner that permits the workpiece to rotate around an axis parallel to a direction of a horizontal Z axis; a tool post configured to hold a tool that comprises a holder and a bit, the holder having a longitudinal axis extending lengthwise, the bit being provided at an end, lengthwise, of the holder, at least one of the tool post and the workpiece holding device being configured to be movable to allow relative movement of the tool held by the tool post and the workpiece held by the workpiece holding device in three directions of an X axis, a Y axis and the Z axis, the X axis being perpendicular to the Z axis, the Y axis being perpendicular to the Z axis and to the X axis, the tool post being configured to perform an operation of indexing the tool held thereby to a position in which the longitudinal axis of the holder is parallel to the X axis direction, wherein the bit of the tool held by the tool post is angled such that a longitudinal axis of the bit is disposed in a position tilted away from the X axis direction closer to a horizontal axis in a plane containing the X axis and the Y axis; and a controller configured to control the relative movement of the tool and the workpiece held by the workpiece holding device, and the operation of the tool post indexing the tool, whereby a turning operation is performed while the tool and/or the workpiece are moved relative to each other in a direction of the longitudinal axis of the bit.	0
Each of the legs 68 a has a reinforcement portion 68 d at an intermediate height position thereof. The reinforcement portion 68 d is provided at approximately the same height position as that of an upper end of the motor 58 .

As shown in FIG. 2B when a flexible container 100 , which may be a plastic storage bag, is used, the internal gas pressure may selected so a that a portion of the container may be compressed between the plates 20 , 30 so as to form a smaller gap to facilitate creation of the ANEP at a lower voltage. Here, the container is shown in a state where a portion 110 of the container 100 is positioned between the electrodes of the DBD apparatus 3 , so that a portion of the container 100 may be temporarily formed into a region where the ANEP may be created. The filaments creating the ANEP are formed between the surface of the dielectric 40 and the other electrode plate 30 , such that there the object 200 to be treated is not disposed therebetween. In this manner, larger objects may be treated without having to use very high voltages. Portions of the container surface disposed so as to form the region in which the ANEP is to be formed are held against the dielectric 40 and the plate 30 by the internal gas pressure. The effect of the dielectric layer of the container surface may be small, as the charge distributions are likely to be dominated by those of the electrodes and the dielectric 40 .	0

Fluid control valves are commonly distributed throughout process control systems to control flow rates and/or pressures of various fluids (e.g. liquids, gases, etc.). A fluid control valve assembly typically includes a valve body, a stem, and an actuator (e.g., a pneumatic actuator) to displace the valve stem to operate the fluid control valve. Typically, movement of an actuator stem moves the valve stem to position a plug or flow control member within the valve. In the case of a diaphragm actuator, an input pressure (e.g., pressurized gas, fluid, etc.) is applied to a chamber of the actuator to displace the diaphragm. The input pressure necessary to displace the diaphragm is typically defined by multiple parameters including diaphragm and spring selection, tolerances of components, assembly variation, etc. Typically, the flow controlled by the actuator is largely defined by component selection and tolerances, thereby resulting in significant variability in actuation response (e.g., input pressure necessary to actuate the diaphragm actuator). Additionally, the operating flow controlled by the fluid control valve may necessitate adjustments to the actuator over the operating life of the actuator as the flow through the fluid control valve may change (e.g., drift) over time.	0

An alternative, but less frequently used, discharging agent is thiourea dioxide which re-arranges under alkaline conditions to form formamidine sulphinic acid. Because of their isomeric relationship the descriptions thiourea dioxide and formamidine sulphinic acid are generally regarded as being synonymous and the term thiourea dioxide in the following may be regarded as embracing formamidine sulphinic acid unless otherwise stated. This, like zinc formaldehyde-sulphoxylate, breaks down during the discharge printing process to the highly reactive sulphoxylic acid, but neither contains nor produces any formaldehyde. However, because it has been generally regarded as an alkaline discharging agent producing, as a consequence, coloured discharge products, thiourea dioxide has limited use in discharge printing. In addition, it has been possible to use thiourea dioxide effectively only on processes involving steaming or in the presence of substantial amounts of non-volatile agents capable of acting as high temperature solvents or reaction media such as polyethylene glycols as described in the UK specifications 939515 and 1026236, as such conditions have, until now, been found necessary for the releasing of the active reaction products. Consequently, it has not been possible to use thiourea dioxide in procedures which do not utilise steam or where washing off undesirable residues is not possible, such as the "unit printing" procedure described above, notwithstanding the fact that it offers, potentially at least, a valuable alternative to zinc formaldehyde sulphoxylate because it leaves no formaldehyde containing residues on the unwashed printed fabric. The present invention addresses this problem by providing a formaldehyde free discharging agent which is effective in both dry heat and steam conditions.	0
The semiconductor material 88 can be conductively doped either as-deposited (i.e., can be in situ doped), and/or can be doped subsequent to the deposition with one or more suitable implants. Also, regions of substrate 12 proximate openings 86 can be appropriately conductively doped either prior to provision of material 88 within the openings, or after provision of material 88 with suitable implants and/or out-diffusion of dopant from material 88 . In some aspects, substrate 12 will have appropriate conductivity-enhancing dopants provided therein at a processing stage prior to that of FIGS. 1-3, and specifically prior to formation of material 14 over the substrate. In alternative, or additional, aspects dopant will be provided in the substrate after the formation of openings 86 so that the dopant is self-aligned to the openings. Particular dopants that can be provided within substrate 12 and regions 88 in particular aspects of the invention are discussed below with reference to FIGS. 124-126.	0

Other positive displacement powder dispersion devices may be used in embodiments of the inventions herein. In a reciprocating positive displacement powder dispersion devices, a stationary slide is mated directly below a reciprocating slide. When aligned, the one or multiple mini portions of powdered fuel are simultaneously released from the upper metering slide, and fall through the lower mask slide, either into an air stream for immediate dispersion, or onto a conveyor belt or shelf or table for subsequent dispersion using techniques described elsewhere herein. A major benefit of this embodiment is the conversion of mini, well controlled portions of explosible powder into a continuous stream flow for accurate volumetric feed control.	0

Computing device 14 is also configured for generating lighting control signals designed to operate various exterior lights responsive to a current location and/or a planned route of the vehicle. In one embodiment, signal generation and transmission are performed by a signaling block 127 controlled by the processor and incorporated into the computing device. If signal processing means are needed, signal processing means 30 may be incorporated into the signaling block 127 or otherwise into the computing device 14 , into the exterior lights themselves, or (as shown in FIG. 1) located along the signal path between the computing device 14 and the controlled exterior lights. Computing device 14 may also be configured for operating multiple exterior lights or types of lights simultaneously, according to the requirements of a particular situation.	0

An exemplary immunoglobulin (antibody) structural unit comprises a tetramer. Each tetramer is composed of two identical pairs of polypeptide chains, each pair having one “light” (about 25 kD) and one “heavy” chain (about 50-70 kD). The N-terminus of each chain defines a variable region of about 100 to 110 or more amino acids primarily responsible for antigen recognition. The terms variable light chain (V L ) and variable heavy chain (V H ) refer to these light and heavy chains respectively.	0
While these prior art devices are generally satisfactory, they are susceptible to malfunction in the event that brilliant light strikes the front of the tape unit. For example, a computer room is often open to public view through large exterior windows. Sunlight may, at a certain time of day, strike the tape unit's vacuum columns and falsely activate the photocells. Also, photographing portions of the computer room, and the attendant use of photoflash sources, may falsely activate the photocells. In either event, servo control of the associated reel motors by the column's photoelectric couples is no longer reliable.	0
In principle, all individual mirrors 23 which form a given facet 68 can be displaced into the same park position. Advantageously, provision is made for the individual mirrors 23 which form a given facet 68 to be distributed to different park positions for the purposes of being switched off. As a result of this, the thermal load on the park facets 73 can be reduced. In particular, it is possible to distribute the thermal load as uniformly as possible to different park facets 73 .	0
In the illustrated embodiment, the downhill slope is used to explain the operation of the controller 80 above. However, the same calculation is possible with the uphill slope shown in FIG. 8.

Also, if the length of the support component 50 and the inclination angle of the grip component 70 after the adjustment are expressed by L 1 ″ and θ 3 ″, respectively, the following equations (13) and (14) are satisfied.	0

Similarly, the system 10 may be configured to activate any pertinent exterior lights prior to entry into a exterior light operating location if the exterior light operating location lies along a planned route of the vehicle (for example, as determined by the GPS or navigation system). For example, the lights may be activated when the vehicle reaches a certain distance from the light operating location. Activation of the lights prior to reaching the exterior light operating location ensures that the lights will be switched on for maximum visibility if and when the vehicle enters the exterior light operating location, in spite of any variations in vehicle speed between the vehicle's current position and the exterior light operating location.	0
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS	0
As previously described, during pumping operations, outlet valve 560 of upper valve assembly 500 controls the flow of well fluids 15 from section 121 a into tubing 40 . In particular, valve members 580 , 590 are biased to closed positions engaging seats 563 , 561 b , respectively, and valve seats 563 , 561 b are axially positioned between valve heads 581 , 591 , respectively, and section 121 a . Thus, when the pressure in chamber 121 a is less than to or greater than the pressure in passage 113 and coupling 45 , valves heads 581 , 591 sealingly engage valve seats 563 , 561 b , respectively, thereby restricting and/or preventing fluid flow between coupling 45 and section 121 a . However, as piston 122 begins to move axially upward within chamber 121 , the volume of section 121 a decreases and the pressure therein increases. As the pressure in section 121 a increases above the pressure in passage 112 and coupling 45 , the pressure differential seeks to urge valves members 580 , 590 axially upward and out of engagement with seats 563 , 561 b , respectively. Biasing members 569 , 579 bias valve members 580 , 590 , respectively, in the opposite axial direction and seek to maintain sealing engagement between biasing members valve heads 581 , 591 and valve seats 563 , 561 b , respectively. However, once the pressure in section 121 a is sufficiently high (i.e., high enough that the pressure differential between section 121 a and passage 112 is sufficient to overcome biasing members 569 ), valve member 580 will unseat from seat 563 and compresses biasing member 569 . Then, almost instantaneously, the combination of the relatively high pressure in section 121 a and relatively lower pressure in passage 112 overcome biasing member 579 , valve member 590 unseats from seat 561 b , thereby transitioning outlet valve 560 to an “opened” position allowing fluid communication between passage 112 and section 121 a . Since the pressure in section 121 a is greater than the pressure of well fluids 15 in passage 112 , well fluids 15 will flow through outlet valve 560 from section 121 a into passage 112 , coupling 45 , and tubing 40 . In this embodiment, biasing members 569 , 579 provide different biasing forces. In particular, biasing member 569 provides a lower biasing force than biasing member 579 (e.g., biasing member 569 is a lighter duty coil spring than biasing member 579 ).	0
Then, a rinsing cycle is performed to remove detergent remnants in S 136 . The rinsing cycle is performed once or more by supplying wash water into the tub 105 through the water supply valve 135 .
